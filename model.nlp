Our team believes this will enhance collaboration and efficiency across departments. I have submitted this request in the #operations Slack channel and created a ticket for the IT and security teams in Jira. Additionally, I have attached documentation on the access requirements and usage guidelines: (1) A PDF summarizing the access levels needed and set-up details within GMail and GSheets (2) A document explaining steps that need to be taken to activate the services and an FAQ about the usage policies. Furthermore, I have created a Loom video at the link below that demonstrates the initial setup and usage of GMail and GSheets for project management. I figured this demo would be useful for the IT and Security teams conducting their review. Once a reviewing resource is assigned, please reach out to me to be granted access to view the Loom recording. Items #2 and #4 in the Loom recording breakdown below could be useful for the IT and Security team. The Loom recording is broken out as follows: (1) 0 - 5:00 Overview of GMail & GSheets features (2) 5:00-15:00 System-to-System Demonstration (3) 15:00-20:00 Pros/Cons (4) 20:00 - 25:00 Deployment Considerations Background on the access: -The access is required for seamless communication and data management within the project teams. -The proposed access will allow team members to send and receive emails via GMail and collaborate on documents using GSheets. -The access will not include administrative privileges. -The access can be granted to multiple team members as needed. -This is a one-way access; changes made in GSheets will not automatically update in other systems. -Can be scheduled to review access levels every quarter. Background on User Experience: -Employees will be given the option to \"opt out\" of this access within the project management tool. By doing nothing, they will automatically have access to GMail and GSheets. If they opt out, no access will be granted. -The access will appear as \"Enabled\" in the project management tool. -Employees can select their preferred settings in GMail and GSheets to ensure alignment with their work preferences. For IT/Security Teams: -Creation of a user group in the GSuite Admin Console is needed. -OAuth 2.0 credentials will need to be created for this project and shared with the Operations team. In the Loom recording, I demo the GSuite Admin Console set-up - which should take ~15-30 minutes to complete. Thank you for your support! Please reach out to me with questions.

Our team believes this will enhance collaboration and efficiency across departments. I have submitted this request in the #operations Slack channel and created a ticket for the IT and security teams in Jira. Additionally, I have attached documentation on the access requirements and usage guidelines: (1) A PDF summarizing the access levels needed and set-up details within GMail and GSheets (2) A document explaining steps that need to be taken to activate the services and an FAQ about the usage policies. Furthermore, I have created a Loom video at the link below that demonstrates the initial setup and usage of GMail and GSheets for project management. I figured this demo would be useful for the IT and Security teams conducting their review. Once a reviewing resource is assigned, please reach out to me to be granted access to view the Loom recording. Items #2 and #4 in the Loom recording breakdown below could be useful for the IT and Security team. The Loom recording is broken out as follows: (1) 0 - 5:00 Overview of GMail & GSheets features (2) 5:00-15:00 System-to-System Demonstration (3) 15:00-20:00 Pros/Cons (4) 20:00 - 25:00 Deployment Considerations Background on the access: -The access is required for seamless communication and data management within the project teams. -The proposed access will allow team members to send and receive emails via GMail and collaborate on documents using GSheets. -The access will not include administrative privileges. -The access can be granted to multiple team members as needed. -This is a one-way access; changes made in GSheets will not automatically update in other systems. -Can be scheduled to review access levels every quarter. Background on User Experience: -Employees will be given the option to \"opt out\" of this access within the project management tool. By doing nothing, they will automatically have access to GMail and GSheets. If they opt out, no access will be granted. -The access will appear as \"Enabled\" in the project management tool. -Employees can select their preferred settings in GMail and GSheets to ensure alignment with their work preferences. For IT/Security Teams: -Creation of a user group in the GSuite Admin Console is needed. -OAuth 2.0 credentials will need to be created for this project and shared with the Operations team. In the Loom recording, I demo the GSuite Admin Console set-up - which should take ~15-30 minutes to complete. Thank you for your support! Please reach out to me with questions.

Some expectations + reminders: * On your first day, you will need to sign in to your computer by 8:00am local time to get set up before orientation begins. Follow the instructions IT will email you regarding login instructions and credentials. If you have not received your laptop by Monday, no worries! You can still do all of this on your personal device until your laptop arrives. * Your first week will include live sessions via Zoom. The Zoom link for all sessions can be found directly on your calendar. Once we wrap up with our presentations, you will be instructed to complete our online self-guided new hire learning plan through Lessonly. You will find it in your enrolled courses on your home page. * Many of you have already received your laptops (YAY!). If you have not received your laptop yet, you should receive it through FedEx overnight shipping by your start date. If there is a delay with FedEx for any reason, you will still be able to access the Zoom session, as well as your Acme email alias, during Orientation via your personal device. * You’ll be added to all onboarding events for week 1 the Sunday or Monday morning before your start date. Due to the timing of your OKTA credentials + security concerns, we are limited in adding you to these items before OKTA activation. * We’ll dive into all the details of your perks + stipends during week 1.
